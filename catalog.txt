        announced when phone is locked. Bob can no longer see the phone, Jing
        unlocks it and notifications show. Data persisted for analysis.

        phone is unlocked, regardless of presence of Bob (or others). Data 
        persisted for analysis.

        important, because the phone did not show an important notification
        because it was locked NOT because Bob was present.
